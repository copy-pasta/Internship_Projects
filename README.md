1: "A chance of rain" - Composition for prepared Disklavier and SuperCollider


How can one create room for randomness, while not loosing control?
How can the the use of the Disklavier, a piano controlled by MIDI, break the limits imposed by human piano technique ? 
How can one create a structure for improvisation to unfold within?

The piece “A chance of rain” for prepared Disklavier and SuperCollider, examines the relationship between indeterminacy and planned composition and aims to explore the freedom a Disklavier offers a performer in interacting with a prepared piano. 
Structurally the peace consists of various semi-random patterns, constrained solely by the definition of boundaries in which randomness and probability can control sonic parameters, such as note range, length, velocity etc. Markov chains dictate the flow between larger form parts. As the SuperCollider algorithms “play” the Disklavier’s keyboard, another layer of indeterminism is added by a performer improvising on the inside of the piano, altering the preparation in reaction to the Code. This offers the performer to explore piano techniques beyond the limits of a human player and enables the performer to shift the focus of his interaction away from the keys, to the inside of the piano.

2:  __.__ Audiovisual Live Coding Performance

How can one interact with this multi-medially connected world? 
How can the World Wide Web help us foster collaboration no matter the geographic location? 
__.__ is an audiovisual network performance based on the practice of Live Coding, seeking answers to these questions; questions that are becoming increasingly relevant in times of COVID-19.
The technical set up consists of three geographically separated computers, which are connected only via the internet. Messages, sent back and forth between the players with the OSC protocol, and information of the network itself, such as latency, drive audiovisual parameters inside SuperCollider and Processing. 
Each circle on the screen represents an incoming message sent from another player. 
Different Modes, triggered via Midi, change the rules by which these circles connect.
In mode 1, lines are drawn only between the messages of the same sender. In mode 2, circles between different senders connect and in mode 3 there are no connections at all.

Conception and Performance: Shu Ching Chong, Jia Liu and Jacqueline Butzinger
